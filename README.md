# HitPredict

## Project Overview

HitPredict is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the popularity of songs using Spotify data and building a personalized music recommendation system. This project leverages pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and various other libraries for analyzing and modeling song features.

## Features

- Predict song popularity based on various musical features.
- Build personalized music recommendations using collaborative and content-based filtering.
- Clean and analyze large datasets using pandas and NumPy.
- Train machine learning models using scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

## Setup & Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (optional)
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

### Data

The initial data was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs?resource=download&select=spotify_songs.csv . It was then preprocessed and saved in different csv files in the data folder.

### Notebooks

The notebooks folder contains Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling.
